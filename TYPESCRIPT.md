# TypeScript Migration for bitnami-pgvector

## Overview

This document describes the migration of the bitnami-pgvector project from JavaScript to TypeScript, including the setup of the Biome linter and code quality tools.

## Changes Made

1. **Moved test files to TypeScript**
   - Converted `tests/pgtest.js` and `tests/vector_test.js` to TypeScript
   - Moved tests to `src/tests/` directory
   - Added proper TypeScript types and interfaces

2. **Added Type Definitions**
   - Added PostgreSQL type definitions with `@types/pg`
   - Improved type safety throughout the codebase
   - Added proper error handling with typed errors

3. **Set up Biome Linter**
   - Configured Biome for TypeScript and JavaScript linting
   - Added formatting rules for consistent code style
   - Created npm scripts for linting, formatting, and checking

4. **Updated Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created TypeScript-native test setup for pgvector extension
   - Added bash script for running all tests (`run_tests.sh`)
   - Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use Bun instead of Node.js

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated README to reflect TypeScript migration
   - Added new features to README feature list
   - Created this document for migration documentation

## New Scripts

The following npm scripts have been added to the project:

- `lint`: Run Biome linter on src directory
- `lint:fix`: Run Biome linter with automatic fixes
- `format`: Format code with Biome
- `check`: Perform lint, format, and type checking
- `test:ts`: Run unit tests from src directory
- `test:pg`: Run PostgreSQL connection test
- `test:vector`: Run pgvector extension test
- `test:postgres`: Run all PostgreSQL-related tests

## Biome Linter Configuration

The Biome linter is configured in `biome.json` with the following rules:

- Enforce recommended rules
- Error on unused variables
- Warn on explicit any usage
- Error on constant variable reassignment
- Require proper Node.js import protocol usage

## TypeScript Configuration

TypeScript is configured in `tsconfig.json` with:

- ES module support
- Strict type checking
- Node.js and Bun type definitions

## CI/CD Changes

The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to:

- Use Bun instead of Node.js
- Run TypeScript tests directly
- Install dependencies with Bun
- Use a more lightweight Debian container for testing

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more type-safe abstractions for PostgreSQL and pgvector interactions
- Expand test coverage for edge cases
- Explore using TypeScript for other scripts in the project
